abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regardless of the proportion of missing values, complete-case analysis is most frequently applied, although advanced techniques such as multiple imputation (MI) are available. The objective of this study was to explore the performance of simple and more advanced methods for handling missing data in cases when some, many, or all item scores are missing in a multi-item instrument.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Real-life missing data situations were simulated in a multi-item variable used as a covariate in a linear regression model. Various missing data mechanisms were simulated with an increasing percentage of missing data. Subsequently, several techniques to handle missing data were applied to decide on the most optimal technique for each scenario. Fitted regression coefficients were compared using the bias and coverage as performance parameters.

RESULTS: Mean imputation caused biased estimates in every missing data scenario when data are missing for more than 10% of the subjects. Furthermore, when a large percentage of subjects had missing items (>25%), MI methods applied to the items outperformed methods applied to the total score.

CONCLUSION: We recommend applying MI to the item scores to get the most accurate regression model estimates. Moreover, we advise not to use any form of mean imputation to handle missing data.},

abstract = {Background: Deployment can put soldiers at risk of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Despite several longitudinal studies, little is known about the timing of an increase in post-traumatic stress symptoms relative to pre-deployment. Longitudinal studies starting pre-deployment, in which participants are repeatedly measured over time, are warranted to assess the timing of an increase in symptoms to ultimately assess the timing of an increase in treatment demand after deployment. Methods: In this large observational cohort study, Dutch military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Forces between March, 2005, and September, 2008, were assessed for post-traumatic stress symptoms with the Self-Rating Inventory for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (SRIP) questionnaire. Participants were assessed 1 month before deployment and followed up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 5 years after deployment, with changes in SRIP scores compared with pre-deployment using a mixed model analysis. The primary outcome was the total score of post-traumatic stress symptoms measured with SRIP at pre-deployment and the five follow-up assessments, with a score of 38 used as the cutoff to indicate substantial post-traumatic stress symptoms. Findings: Between March, 2005, and September, 2008, 1007 participants were recruited to this study. The results show two important effects of deployment on post-traumatic stress symptoms. A short-term symptom increase within the first 6 months after deployment (symptom increase coefficient for SRIP score vs pre-deployment [$\beta$] 0{\textperiodcentered}99, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}50-1{\textperiodcentered}48); and a long-term symptom increase at 5 years after deployment ($\beta$ 1{\textperiodcentered}67, 1{\textperiodcentered}14-2{\textperiodcentered}20). Interpretation: This study underlines the importance of long-term monitoring of the psychological health of soldiers after deployment because early detection of symptoms is essential to early treatment, which is related to improved psychological health.

METHODS: We included 262 studies published in 2010 in 3 leading epidemiologic journals. Information was extracted on how missing data were reported, types of missing, and methods for dealing with missing data.

RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the studies lacked clear information about the measurement instruments. Missing data in multi-item instruments were not handled differently from other missing data. Complete-case analysis was most frequently reported (81% of the studies), and the selectivity of missing data was seldom examined.

abstract = {Health care providers need to be aware that stress complaints that result from deployment can emerge even after many years. This has important implications for health care policies. The main aim of this study is to investigate the relation between the development of posttraumatic stress and other mental health complaints and the burden on (mental) health care after a deployment. For this study we used data from a large prospective cohort study on stress-factors related to deployment in 1007 Dutch soldiers, who were deployed to Afghanistan. Participants were assessed at six follow up times up until five years after deployment. In a Generalized Estimated Equations model we estimated the relation between mental health complaints and the utilization of psychological treatment and a general practitioner, respectively. Moreover, we studied the relation between mental health complaints and health care costs using bootstrap techniques. The results showed that higher scores for PTSD, depression and fatigue relate to increased use of a psychologist. And lower PTSD scores and higher depression, anxiety and somatization scores relate to increased odds to visit a GP. Furthermore, mental health complaints relate to higher costs. In conclusion, monitoring soldiers is important in order to be informed on the current demand for (mental) health care to satisfy the health care need of veterans. Early treatment, which is enabled by lowering barriers to care, relates to positive results and therefore, lower health care costs.},

abstract = {Cost and effect data often have missing data because economic evaluations are frequently added onto clinical studies where cost data are rarely the primary outcome. The objective of this article was to investigate which multiple imputation strategy is most appropriate to use for missing cost-effectiveness data in a randomized controlled trial. Three incomplete data sets were generated from a complete reference data set with 17, 35 and 50 % missing data in effects and costs. The strategies evaluated included complete case analysis (CCA), multiple imputation with predictive mean matching (MI-PMM), MI-PMM on log-transformed costs (log MI-PMM), and a two-step MI. Mean cost and effect estimates, standard errors and incremental net benefits were compared with the results of the analyses on the complete reference data set. The CCA, MI-PMM, and the two-step MI strategy diverged from the results for the reference data set when the amount of missing data increased. In contrast, the estimates of the Log MI-PMM strategy remained stable irrespective of the amount of missing data. MI provided better estimates than CCA in all scenarios. With low amounts of missing data the MI strategies appeared equivalent but we recommend using the log MI-PMM with missing data greater than 35 %.},

The aim of this study was to demonstrate two novel methods for dealing with incomplete item scores in outcome variables in longitudinal studies. The performance of these methods was previously examined in a simulation study. The two methods incorporate item information at the background when simultaneously the study outcomes are estimated. Study Design and Setting The investigated methods include the item scores or a summary of a parcel of available item scores as auxiliary variables while using the total score of the multi-item questionnaire as the main focus of the analysis in a latent growth model. That way the items help estimating the incomplete information of the total scores. The methods are demonstrated in two empirical data sets. Results Including the item information results in more precise outcomes in terms of regression coefficient estimates and standard errors, compared with not including item information in the analysis. Conclusion The inclusion of a parcel summary is an efficient method that does not overcomplicate longitudinal growth estimates. Therefore, it is recommended in situations where multi-item questionnaires are used as outcome measure in longitudinal clinical studies with incomplete scores because of missing item scores.},

Objectives To present a new method to estimate a "minimal important change" (MIC) of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scales, based on predictive modeling, and to compare its performance with the MIC based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. To illustrate how the new method deals with variables that modify the MIC across subgroups. Study Design and Setting The new method uses logistic regression analysis and identifies the change score associated with a likelihood ratio of 1 as the MIC. Simulation studies were conducted to investigate under which distributional circumstances both methods produce concordant or discordant results and whether the methods differ in accuracy and precision. Results The "predictive MIC" and the ROC-based MIC were identical when the variances of the change scores in the improved and not-improved groups were equal and the distributions were normal or oppositely skewed. The predictive MIC turned out to be more precise than the ROC-based MIC. The predictive MIC allowed for the testing and estimation of modifying factors such as baseline severity. Conclusion In many situations, the newly described MIC based on predictive modeling yields the same value as the ROC-based MIC but with significantly greater precision. This advantage translates to increased statistical power in MIC studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. The main purpose of this prospective intervention study was to determine whether eating styles after an intensive, partly inpatient, one year combined lifestyle intervention are associated with weight change in the following year in severely obese children and adolescents.A total of 120 participants (8-19 years) with an average SDS-BMI of 3.41 (SD = 0.38) was included. Measurements were conducted at baseline (T0), at the end of treatment (T12) and at the end of follow up two years after baseline (T24). The primary outcome measurement was the $\delta$SDS-BMI between T12 and T24. As primary determinant of weight change after treatment, the participants eating styles were evaluated with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire - child report that measures external, emotional and restraint eating. The association between outcome and determinant was assessed in linear regression analyses. Complete data were available for 76 of the 120 participants.This study shows that for girls a higher score on restraint eating at T12 and a higher score on external eating at T12 were associated with more weight (re)gain in the year after treatment. No statistically significant association with emotional eating at T12 was found. In addition for girls a higher score on external eating at T0 was associated with more weight (re)gain in the year after treatment. Furthermore, the observed changes in eating styles suggest that on average it is possible to influence these with treatment, although the detected changes were different for girls and boys and for the different eating styles.More generally, this study indicates that for girls the levels of restraint and external eating after treatment were associated with the weight change during the following year.

Background: Knowledge is limited on the role the ability to self-regulate plays in the long-term outcome of obesity treatment in children and adolescents with severe obesity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ability to self-regulate after an one year intensive, partly inpatient, combined lifestyle intervention is associated with weight loss maintenance in children and adolescents with severe obesity. Methods: One hundred twenty participants (8-19 years) with an average SDS-BMI of 3.41 and their parents/caregivers were included in an intervention study. As primary determinant of weight loss maintenance, general self-regulation ability was evaluated using two behavioral computer tasks assessing inhibitory control and sensitivity to reward. Results: There was no association between inhibitory control at T12 and $\delta$SDS-BMI between T12 and T24 ({\ss} = 0. 0002; CI 95% = -0.0010-0.0014; P = 0.761). There was also no relation between sensitivity to reward at T12 and $\delta$SDS-BMI between T12 and T24 ({\ss} = -0.0028; CI 95% = -0.0075-0.0019; P = 0.244). None of the psychosocial factors that were examined as moderators, showed a statistically significant interaction, except for parental feeding style (P = 0.023). Conclusions: The ability to self-regulate after an intensive, partly inpatient, multidisciplinary one year intervention for severe obesity in children and adolescents was not associated with the ability to maintain the achieved weight loss during the following year. Factors that explain the large range of long term outcomes need to be elucidated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Objective: The concept of specific agreement (SA) has been proposed for dichotomous outcomes for two or more raters. We aim to extend this concept for variables with more than two ordinal or nominal categories and more than two raters. Study Design and Setting: We used two data sets: four plastic surgeons classifying photographs after breast reconstruction on a 5-point ordinal scale and six raters classifying psychiatric patients into five diagnostic categories. For m raters, all (i.e., m(m−1)/2) pairwise agreement tables were summed to calculate the observed agreement (OA), SA and conditional probabilities. The 95% confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping. Results: SA was calculated for each ordinal or nominal category to examine when one of the raters scored in a specific category, what is the probability that the other raters scored in that same category. And suppose one of the raters scored X 1, what is the probability that the other raters scored X 1 or any of the other categories (conditional probability). It appeared, for example, that among the psychiatric disorders, depression and personality disorders were often mixed up, whereas neurosis was rarely mixed up with schizophrenia. Conclusion: The concept of SA for variables with ordinal and multiple nominal categories provides relevant clinical information. The extension to conditional probabilities of alternative categories broadens the clinical application with examining which categories are most often mixed up.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. Previous studies showed that missing data in multi-item scales can best be handled by multiple imputation of item scores. However, when many scales are used, the number of items will become too large for the imputation model to reliably estimate imputations. A solution is to use passive imputation or a parcel summary score that combine and consequently reduce the number of variables in the imputation model. The performance of these methods was evaluated in a simulation study and illustrated in an example. Passive imputation, which updated scale scores from imputed items, and parcel summary scores that use the average over available item scores were compared to using all items simultaneously, imputing total scores of scales and complete-case analysis. Scale scores and coefficient estimates from linear regression were compared to “true” parameters on bias and precision. Passive imputation and using parcel summaries showed smaller bias and more precision than imputing total scores and complete-case analyses. Passive imputation or using parcel summary scores are valid missing data solutions in studies that include many multi-item scales.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology. Background: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging can be used to diagnose and subtype basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but relies on individual morphologic pattern recognition that might vary among users. Objectives: We assessed the inter-rater and intrarater agreement of RCM in correctly diagnosing and subtyping BCC. Methods: In this prospective study, we evaluated the inter-rater and intrarater agreement of RCM on BCC presence and subtype among three raters with varying experience who independently assessed static images of 48 RCM cases twice with four-week interval (T1 and T2). Histopathologic confirmation of presence and subtype of BCC from surgical excision specimen was defined as the reference standard. Results: The inter-rater agreement of RCM for BCC presence showed an agreement of 82% at T1 and 84% at T2. The agreements for subtyping BCC were lower (52% for T1 and 47% for T2). The intrarater agreement of RCM for BCC presence showed an observed agreement that varied from 79% to 92%. The observed agreements for subtyping varied from 56% to 71%. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results show that RCM is reliable in correctly diagnosing BCC based on the assessment of static RCM images. RCM could potentially play an important role in BCC management if accurate subtyping will be achieved. Therefore, future clinical studies on reliability and specific RCM features for BCC subtypes are required.},

Objectives: The objective of this article was to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of the two most prominent types of case management in the Netherlands (intensive case management and linkage models) against no access to case management (control group) for people with already diagnosed dementia and their informal caregivers. Methods: The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective embedded within a two year prospective, observational, controlled, cohort study with 521 informal caregivers and community-dwelling persons with dementia. Case management provided within one care organization (intensive case management model, ICMM), case management where care was provided by different care organizations within one region (Linkage model, LM), and a group with no access to case management (control) were compared. The economic evaluation related incremental costs to incremental effects regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), psychological health of the informal caregiver (GHQ-12), and quality adjusted life years (QALY) of the person with dementia and informal caregiver. Results: Inverse-propensity-score-weighted models showed no significant differences in clinical or total cost outcomes between the three groups. Informal care costs were significantly lower in the ICMM group compared to both other groups. Day center costs were significantly lower in the ICMM group compared to the control group. For all outcomes, the probability that the ICMM was cost-effective in comparison with LM and the control group was larger than 0.97 at a threshold ratio of 0 €/incremental unit of effect. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that the ICMM is cost-effective compared to the control group and the LM. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution since this study was not a randomized controlled trial.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd Particulate matter exposure may cause adverse health effects. Although ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) is hypothesised to be particularly health relevant, the number of studies into personal UFP exposure is limited. Aim To increase insight where and when most UFP exposure occurs, in terms of exposure levels and peaks in microenvironments, time of day and activities, to support development of abatement strategies to reduce exposure. Methods UFP exposure and GPS tracks were recorded continuously for 5 days in 12 healthy volunteers. GPS data was processed to assign context information, and linked to UFP data. Results Participants spent most time indoors ( > 90%), mainly at home (approx. 80%). Mean particle number concentration (particles/cm 3 ) was highest in motorized transport (20.5 × 10 3 ), followed by other indoor environments (16.5 × 10 3 ), and lower at home (11.2 × 10 3 ) and walking outdoors (9.0 × 10 3 ). Due to the large proportion of time spent indoors, exposure indoors contributed most to total exposure (nearly 90%). Exposure during motorized transport showed a speed dependency, most likely linked to exposure on larger busier roads. Using a 95th percentile cut-off for concentration elevations lasting at least 5 min for peak-detection, 98 peaks were identified, mainly during daytime. These contributed substantially to total exposure (25%) while accounting for only 3.4% of total time. Of this peak contribution 88% occurred indoors (mainly at home) and 12% outdoors. Conclusions UFP exposure shows clear differences between microenvironments. Peaks contribute substantially to total exposure. Measures to prevent peak exposures could contribute to substantial exposure reduction.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Objective: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it is of major importance to identify non-responders to tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ inhibitors (TNFi) before starting treatment, to prevent a delay in effective treatment. We developed a protein score for the response to TNFi treatment in RA and investigated its predictive value. Method: In RA patients eligible for biological treatment included in the BiOCURA registry, 53 inflammatory proteins were measured using xMAP{\textregistered} technology. A supervised cluster analysis method, partial least squares (PLS), was used to select the best combination of proteins. Using logistic regression, a predictive model containing readily available clinical parameters was developed and the potential of this model with and without the protein score to predict European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was assessed using the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) and the net reclassification index (NRI). Results: For the development step (n = 65 patient), PLS revealed 12 important proteins: CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein, MIP1a), CCL17 (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine), CCL19 (MIP3b), CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine), interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14), sCD74 (macrophage migration inhibitory factor), soluble IL-1 receptor I, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor II. The protein score scarcely improved the AUC-ROC (0.72 to 0.77) and the ability to improve classification and reclassification (NRI = 0.05). In validation (n = 185), the model including protein score did not improve the AUC-ROC (0.71 to 0.67) or the reclassification (NRI = −0.11). Conclusion: No proteomic predictors were identified that were more suitable than clinical parameters in distinguishing TNFi non-responders from responders before the start of treatment. As the results of previous studies and this study are disparate, we currently have no proteomic predictors for the response to TNFi.},

The objective of this study was to explore the performance of simple and more advanced methods for handling missing data in cases when some, many, or all item scores are missing in a multi-item instrument. Study Design and Setting Real-life missing data situations were simulated in a multi-item variable used as a covariate in a linear regression model. Various missing data mechanisms were simulated with an increasing percentage of missing data. Subsequently, several techniques to handle missing data were applied to decide on the most optimal technique for each scenario. Fitted regression coefficients were compared using the bias and coverage as performance parameters. Results Mean imputation caused biased estimates in every missing data scenario when data are missing for more than 10% of the subjects. Furthermore, when a large percentage of subjects had missing items ( > 25%), MI methods applied to the items outperformed methods applied to the total score. Conclusion We recommend applying MI to the item scores to get the most accurate regression model estimates. Moreover, we advise not to use any form of mean imputation to handle missing data.{\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: In 2010, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was introduced in the Dutch National Immunization Program for 12-year-old girls, aiming to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in women. HPV vaccination uptake turned out to be lower than expected: 61% versus 70%, respectively. Mothers were shown to play the most important role in the immunization decision about this vaccination. They had also expressed their need for interactive personal information about the HPV vaccination over and above the existing universal general information. To improve the effectiveness of the existing education about the HPV vaccination, we systematically developed a Web-based tailored intervention with virtual assistants providing mothers of girls to be invited with tailored feedback on their decision making about the HPV vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Web-based tailored intervention for promoting HPV vaccination acceptance by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Mothers were recruited via the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (n=36,000) and three Web-based panels (n=2483). Those who gave informed consent (N=8062) were randomly assigned to the control (n=4067) or intervention condition (n=3995). HPV vaccination uptake, as registered by Praeventis once the HPV vaccination round was completed, was used as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were differential scores across conditions between baseline (before the provided access to the new tailored intervention) and follow-up (just before the first vaccination) regarding the mothers' degree of informed decision making (IDM), decisional conflict, and critical determinants of HPV vaccination uptake among which are intention, attitude, risk perception, and outcome beliefs. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis (N=8062) showed a significant positive effect of the intervention on IDM, decisional conflict, and nearly all determinants of HPV vaccination uptake (P < .001). No effect was found on uptake (P=.60). This may be attributed to the overall high uptake rates in both conditions. Mothers evaluated the intervention as highly positive, including the website as well as the virtual assistants that were used to deliver the tailored feedback. Conclusions: This computer-tailored intervention has the potential to improve HPV vaccination acceptability and IDM and to decrease decisional conflict among mothers of invited girls. Implications for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. Anger and aggression are frequent problems in deployed military personnel. A lowered threshold of perceiving and responding to threat can trigger impulsive aggression. This can be indicated by an exaggerated startle response. Fifty-two veterans with anger and aggression problems (Anger group) and 50 control veterans were tested using a startle experiment with 10 startle probes and 10 prepulse trials, presented in a random order and with a random interval between the trials. Predictors (demographics, Trait Anger, State Anger, Harm Avoidance and Anxious Arousal) for the startle response within the Anger group were tested. Increased EMG responses were found to the startle probes in the Anger Group compared to the Control group, but not to the prepulse trials. Furthermore, Harm Avoidance and State Anger predicted the increased startle reflex within the Anger group, whereas Trait Anger was negatively related to the startle reflex. These findings indicate that threat reactivity is increased in anger and aggression problems. These problems are not only caused by an anxious predisposition, the degree of anger also predicts the startle reflex.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors Background In the Netherlands, HPV-vaccination uptake among 12-year-old girls remains to be lower (61% in 2016) than expected. The present study is about 1) replicating the extent to which social-psychological determinants found in earlier cross-sectional studies explain HPV-vaccination intention, and 2) testing whether HPV-vaccination intention, as well as other social-psychological determinants, are good predictors of future HPV-vaccination uptake in a longitudinal design. Methods A random sample of mothers of girls invited for the vaccination in 2015 was drawn from the Dutch vaccination register (Praeventis) (N = 36,000) and from three online panels (N = 2483). Two months prior to the vaccination of girls, their mothers were requested to complete a web-based questionnaire by letter (Praeventis sample) or by e-mail (panel samples). HPV-vaccination uptake was derived from Praeventis. Backward linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine most dominant predictors of HPV-vaccination intention and uptake, respectively. The total sample used for data analyses consisted of 8062 mothers. Response rates were 18% for the Praeventis sample and 47% for the panel samples. Results HPV-vaccination intention was best explained by attitude, beliefs, subjective norms, habit, and perceived relative effectiveness of the vaccination; they explained 83% of the variance in HPV-vaccination intention. Intention appeared to be the only stable predictor of HPV-vaccination uptake and explained 43% of the variance in HPV-vaccination uptake. Conclusions These results confirm what was found by earlier cross-sectional studies, and provide strong leads for selecting relevant targets in the planning of future communication strategies aiming to improve HPV-vaccination uptake.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Objectives Patients have their individual minimal important changes (iMICs) as their personal benchmarks to determine whether a perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) change constitutes a (minimally) important change for them. We denote the mean iMIC in a group of patients as the “genuine MIC” (gMIC). The aims of this paper are (1) to examine the relationship between the gMIC and the anchor-based minimal important change (MIC), determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis or by predictive modeling; (2) to examine the impact of the proportion of improved patients on these MICs; and (3) to explore the possibility to adjust the MIC for the influence of the proportion of improved patients. Study Design and Setting Multiple simulations of patient samples involved in anchor-based MIC studies with different characteristics of HRQOL (change) scores and distributions of iMICs. In addition, a real data set is analyzed for illustration. Results The receiver operating characteristic–based and predictive modeling MICs equal the gMIC when the proportion of improved patients equals 0.5. The MIC is estimated higher than the gMIC when the proportion improved is greater than 0.5, and the MIC is estimated lower than the gMIC when the proportion improved is less than 0.5. Using an equation including the predictive modeling MIC, the log-odds of improvement, the standard deviation of the HRQOL change score, and the correlation between the HRQOL change score and the anchor results in an adjusted MIC reflecting the gMIC irrespective of the proportion of improved patients. Conclusion Adjusting the predictive modeling MIC for the proportion of improved patients assures that the adjusted MIC reflects the gMIC. Limitations: We assumed normal distributions and global perceived change scores that were independent on the follow-up score. Additionally, floor and ceiling effects were not taken into account.},

In a logistic regression model, to consider whether a categorical covariate with more than two levels significantly contributes to the model, different methods are available. For example pooling chi-square tests with multiple degrees of freedom, pooling likelihood ratio test statistics, and pooling based on the covariance matrix of the regression model. These methods are more complex than RR and are not available in all mainstream statistical software packages. In addition, they do not always obtain optimal power levels. We argue that the median of the p-values from the overall significance tests from the analyses on the imputed datasets can be used as an alternative pooling rule for categorical variables. The aim of the current study is to compare different methods to test a categorical variable for significance after multiple imputation on applicability and power. Methods: In a large simulation study, we demonstrated the control of the type I error and power levels of different pooling methods for categorical variables. Results: This simulation study showed that for non-significant categorical covariates the type I error is controlled and the statistical power of the median pooling rule was at least equal to current multiple parameter tests. An empirical data example showed similar results. Conclusions: It can therefore be concluded that using the median of the p-values from the imputed data analyses is an attractive and easy to use alternative method for significance testing of categorical variables.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Objective For assessing interrater agreement, the concepts of observed agreement and specific agreement have been proposed. The situation of two raters and dichotomous outcomes has been described, whereas often, multiple raters are involved. We aim to extend it for more than two raters and examine how to calculate agreement estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study Design and Setting As an illustration, we used a reliability study that includes the scores of four plastic surgeons classifying photographs of breasts of 50 women after breast reconstruction into “satisfied” or “not satisfied.” In a simulation study, we checked the hypothesized sample size for calculation of 95% CIs. Results For m raters, all pairwise tables [ie, m (m − 1)/2] were summed. Then, the discordant cells were averaged before observed and specific agreements were calculated. The total number (N) in the summed table is m (m − 1)/2 times larger than the number of subjects (n), in the example, N = 300 compared to n = 50 subjects times m = 4 raters. A correction of n√(m − 1) was appropriate to find 95% CIs comparable to bootstrapped CIs. Conclusion The concept of observed agreement and specific agreement can be extended to more than two raters with a valid estimation of the 95% CIs.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. Health care providers need to be aware that stress complaints that result from deployment can emerge even after many years. This has important implications for health care policies. The main aim of this study is to investigate the relation between the development of posttraumatic stress and other mental health complaints and the burden on (mental) health care after a deployment. For this study we used data from a large prospective cohort study on stress-factors related to deployment in 1007 Dutch soldiers, who were deployed to Afghanistan. Participants were assessed at six follow up times up until five years after deployment. In a Generalized Estimated Equations model we estimated the relation between mental health complaints and the utilization of psychological treatment and a general practitioner, respectively. Moreover, we studied the relation between mental health complaints and health care costs using bootstrap techniques. The results showed that higher scores for PTSD, depression and fatigue relate to increased use of a psychologist. And lower PTSD scores and higher depression, anxiety and somatization scores relate to increased odds to visit a GP. Furthermore, mental health complaints relate to higher costs. In conclusion, monitoring soldiers is important in order to be informed on the current demand for (mental) health care to satisfy the health care need of veterans. Early treatment, which is enabled by lowering barriers to care, relates to positive results and therefore, lower health care cost s.},

Objectives The study aimed to investigate the relative and absolute risks of early exit from paid employment among older workers with a chronic disease, and to assess whether these risks differ across educational groups. Methods Data on chronic diseases and demographics from 9160 Dutch workers aged 45-64 years were enriched with monthly information on employment status from Statistics Netherlands. Subdistribution hazard ratios (SHR) and 7-year probabilities among workers with a chronic disease of exit from paid employment through disability benefits, unemployment benefits, early retirement benefits or economic inactivity were estimated using competing risks regression analyses based on Fine and Gray's models. Results Workers with one chronic disease had a higher risk to exit paid employment through disability benefits (SHR 4.48 (95%CI 3.22 to 6.25)) compared with workers without chronic disease, and this risk further increased for multiple chronic diseases (SHR 8.91 (95%CI 6.33 to 12.55)). As occurrence of chronic diseases was highest among low educated workers, the 7-year probabilities to exit paid employment through disability benefits were highest among this group. Cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, psychological and respiratory diseases were associated with disability benefits (SHRs ranging from 2.11 (95%CI 1.45 to 3.07) to 3.26 (95%CI 2.08 to 5.12)), whereas psychological diseases were also related to unemployment (SHR 1.78 (95%CI 1.33 to 2.38)). Conclusions Older workers with a chronic disease have a higher risk to exit paid employment through disability benefits. As multimorbidity has an additive effect, addressing multimorbidity as a risk factor for sustainable employment is needed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) may have a life-long impact on mental health and are related to physical disease, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. Research on ACEs suffers from recall bias when performed with adults. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of ACEs and the interrelationships between ACEs as reported by children, and to determine the impact on their self-reported quality of life (QoL). Children's opinions on the ACE-Questionnaire were also obtained. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a child version of the ACE-Questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses parental separation or divorce, physical and emotional child abuse and neglect, sexual violence, domestic violence, household substance abuse, psychological issues or suicide, and incarceration of a household member. QoL was measured with the Kidscreen-10. Participants and setting: The questionnaire was completed by 644 children at a mean age of 11 years (range 9–13 years), in the two last grades of regular elementary schools, recruited throughout the Netherlands. Results: Data were weighted by ethnicity to obtain a representative sample of children in Dutch elementary education. Of all children, 45.3% had one or more out of ten ACEs. Child maltreatment was experienced by 26.4%. ACEs often co-occurred. A higher number of ACEs correlated with a lower mean level of QoL (p < 0.001). Mean QoL was 8.5 points lower (Cohen's d = 0.8) in children who experienced child maltreatment. Children's opinions on the questionnaire were positive in 82.4%. Conclusion: Prevention of ACEs, professional training and trauma-focus in schools are urgently needed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Author(s). Background: Logistic regression is often used for mediation analysis with a dichotomous outcome. However, previous studies showed that the indirect effect and proportion mediated are often affected by a change of scales in logistic regression models. To circumvent this, standardization has been proposed. The aim of this study was to show the relative performance of the unstandardized and standardized estimates of the indirect effect and proportion mediated based on multiple regression, structural equation modeling, and the potential outcomes framework for mediation models with a dichotomous outcome. Methods: We compared the performance of the effect estimates yielded by the three methods using a simulation study and two real-life data examples from an observational cohort study (n = 360). Results: Lowest bias and highest efficiency were observed for the estimates from the potential outcomes framework and for the crude indirect effect ab and the proportion mediated ab/(ab + c') based on multiple regression and SEM. Conclusions: We advise the use of either the potential outcomes framework estimates or the ab estimate of the indirect effect and the ab/(ab + c') estimate of the proportion mediated based on multiple regression and SEM when mediation analysis is based on logistic regression. Standardization of the coefficients prior to estimating the indirect effect and the proportion mediated may not increase the performance of these estimates.},

Background: Childhood trauma and combat-related trauma are both associated with decreased psychosocial functioning. Coping strategies play an important role in the adjustment to traumatic events. Objective: The present study examined childhood trauma and the mediating role of coping strategies in adult psychological symptoms in a non-clinical military population after deployment to Afghanistan. Additionally, the moderating role of coping strategies in vulnerability to combat events was explored. Method: Participants (N = 932) were drawn from a prospective study assessing psychological complaints (SCL-90), early trauma (ETISR-SF), combat-related events and coping strategies (Brief COPE). Mediation analyses via joint significance testing and moderation analyses were performed. Results: Childhood trauma is related to adult symptoms of general anxiety, depression and problems concerning interpersonal sensitivity through the mediation of self-blame as a coping strategy. Some evidence was found that self-blame moderated vulnerability to combat-related events resulting in psychological complaints, specifically symptoms of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Military personnel should be made aware of self-criticizing maladaptive belief systems when dealing with aversive events. Negative beliefs about oneself and distorted trauma-related cognitions may have a basis in childhood events. Self-blame cognitions may be a potential mechanism of change in empirically supported trauma interventions such as cognitive processing therapy.},

Purpose The aim of this study was to develop prediction models to determine the risk of sick leave due to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) in non-sick listed employees and to compare models for short-term (i.e., 3 months) and long-term (i.e., 12 months) predictions. Methods Cohort study including 49,158 Dutch employees who participated in occupational health checks between 2009 and 2015 and sick leave data recorded during 12 months follow-up. Prediction models for MSD sick leave within 3 and 12 months after the health check were developed with logistic regression analysis using routinely assessed health check variables. The performance of the prediction models was evaluated with explained variance (Nagelkerke's R-square), calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow test) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) measures. Results A total of 376 (0.8%) and 1193 (2.4%) employees had MSD sick leave within 3 and 12 months after the health check. The prediction models included similar predictor variables (educational level, musculoskeletal complaints, distress, supervisor social support, work-home interference, intrinsic motivation, development opportunities, and work pace). The explained variances were 7.6% and 8.8% for the model with 3 and 12 months follow-up, respectively. Both prediction models showed adequate calibration and discriminated between employees with and without MSD sick leave 3 months (AUC = 0.761; Interquartile range [IQR] 0.759–0.763) and 12 months (AUC = 0.740; IQR 0.738–0.741) after the health check. Conclusion The prediction models could be used to determine the risk of MSD sick leave in non-sick listed employees and invite them to preventive consultations with occupational health providers.},

abstract = {Background: Gestational weight gain differs according to pre-pregnancy body mass index and is related to the risks of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Gestational weight gain charts for women in different pre-pregnancy body mass index groups enable identification of women and offspring at risk for adverse health outcomes. We aimed to construct gestational weight gain reference charts for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grades 1, 2 and 3 obese women and to compare these charts with those obtained in women with uncomplicated term pregnancies. Methods: We used individual participant data from 218,216 pregnant women participating in 33 cohorts from Europe, North America, and Oceania. Of these women, 9065 (4.2%), 148,697 (68.1%), 42,678 (19.6%), 13,084 (6.0%), 3597 (1.6%), and 1095 (0.5%) were underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. A total of 138, 517 women from 26 cohorts had pregnancies with no hypertensive or diabetic disorders and with term deliveries of appropriate for gestational age at birth infants. Gestational weight gain charts for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grade 1, 2, and 3 obese women were derived by the Box-Cox t method using the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape. Results: We observed that gestational weight gain strongly differed per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index group. The median (interquartile range) gestational weight gain at 40 weeks was 14.2 kg (11.4-17.4) for underweight women, 14.5 kg (11.5-17.7) for normal weight women, 13.9 kg (10.1-17.9) for overweight women, and 11.2 kg (7.0-15.7), 8.7 kg (4.3-13.4) and 6.3 kg (1.9-11.1) for grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. The rate of weight gain was lower in the first half than in the second half of pregnancy. No differences in the patterns of weight gain were observed between cohorts or countries. Similar weight gain patterns were observed in mothers without pregnancy complications. Conclusions: Gestational weight gain patterns are strongly related to pre-pregnancy body mass index. The derived charts can be used to assess gestational weight gain in etiological research and as a monitoring tool for weight gain during pregnancy in clinical practice.},
